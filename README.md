So this is the repo that we all should use I think. If I set it up correctly.
If I didn't set this up correctly, feel free to make another one.

On the crunchbox in graf I set up a github account. It's name is "osuauv". I did this so that we wouldn't have to have people's private keys on the box. If you make a commit on the box, it wont have your real name, just "osuauv"
